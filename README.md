# ChiLay - a graph layout framework along with some layout algorithms

Provides a graph layout framework along with a number of layout algorithms implemented in Java. Layout services can be used locally or remotely (through HTTP) from a server.

JavaScript versions of most of these layout algorithms were implemented as [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) extensions in various repositories in [GitHub](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent).
